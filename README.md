The Musicians' Website

Mobile music is music which is downloaded or streamed to mobile phones and played by mobile phones. Although many phones play music as ringtones, true "music phones" generally allow users to stream music or download music files over the internet via a WiFi connection or 3G cell phone connection. Music phones are also able to import audio files from their PCs. The case of mobile music being stored within the memory of the mobile phone is the case similar to traditional business models in the music industry. It supports two variants: the user can either purchase the music for outright ownership or access entire libraries of music via a subscription model. In this case the music files are available as long as the subscription is active.
A website is a great platform for a musician to publicize their music. The musician is able to actively involve with his audience and introduce his works effectively through a single platform. A website also largely influences his/her chances of collaborating with fellow musicians. Other musicians are able to know a great deal of information about the musician by visiting his website. The following are some of the motives of a musician to create a website for himself/herself:
1.	Create an image and gain exposure.
2.	Promote and book upcoming gigs.
3.	Build a community and earn money.

* Use of WAMP server for the database connections and storing the data.
* Some data maybe invisible since the .sql file is missing
